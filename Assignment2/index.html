                My love for technology began in my highschool years, I new there was more into computer studies than
                packages and computer parts we were learning. I would look at my computer teacher and think to myself
                "she's so cool" little did she knew all her guidance and passion ignited mine. During my last year we
                were
                to choose courses for our university, I believed her guidance helped me land my dream course.

                formatting of

                A <b>margin</b> is the space around an element's border, while <b>padding </b>is the space between an
                element's border
                and
                the element's content.
                <b>Border</b> is the strip that goes around your <i>div/element</i> of the content.
